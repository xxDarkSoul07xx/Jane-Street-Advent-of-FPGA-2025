# Jane Street Advent of FPGA 2025

I chose to do problem 1: https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1

The reason for the naming like Design1 and sequential is because I initially wanted to do a sequential design and then a pipelined design. After the sequential one was working, I tried to pipeline and quickly realized I don't have the experience for it, but I hope to gain enough in the future to do so.
